# machine-learning
This repository contains java implementation of following algorithms:
  - Simple linear regression
  - Multiple linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - One vs Rest
  - Gradient descent
  - Parallel stochastic gradient descent for text classification
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Classification Tree
  - K means
  - Perceptron 
  - Delta rule
  - Bootstrap Aggregation
  - Stacked generalization
  - Random forest
  
There are also built-in methods to evaluate an algorithm with:
   - stratified k-fold
   - N-iterations train and test split
  
There are 4 runnable examples:
  - AND function solved with perceptron and delta rule,
  - Binary classification of Iris data set with perceptron and delta rule, as well as clustering with K-means,
  - Linear regression for a stock price with delta rule.
  - Sms spam detector with naive algorithms.bayes
  
Note that 'tests' are somewhat ugly, but will be prettified eventually.

  
# future improvements
The repository will be expanded with more algorithms, data preparation, feature analysis, evaluation metrics and so on as i find free time to do this.
Improved documentation and code quality.

# PRESENTATION
Resources directory contains presentation with detailed explanation of Naive Bayes, Perceptron and Delta rule as well as overview of Multi-layer feed forward networks.

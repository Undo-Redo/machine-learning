# machine-learning
This repository contains java implementation of following algorithms:
  - Simple linear regression
  - Multiple linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Classification Tree
  - K means
  - Perceptron 
  - Delta rule
  - Bootstrap Aggregation
  - Stacked generalization
  - Random forest
  
There are 4 runnable examples:
  - AND function solved with perceptron and delta rule,
  - Binary classification of Iris data set with perceptron and delta rule, as well as clustering with K-means,
  - Linear regression for a stock price with delta rule.
  - Sms spam detector with naive algorithms.bayes
  
Note that tests are somewhat ugly, but will be prettified eventually.
  
The repository will be expanded with more algorithms, data preparation, feature analysis, evaluation metrics and so on as i find free time to do this.

# PRESENTATION
Resources directory contains presentation with detailed explanation of Naive Bayes, Perceptron and Delta rule as well as overview of Multi-layer feed forward networks.

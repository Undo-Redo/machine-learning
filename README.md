# machine-learning
This repository contains java implementation of following algorithms:
  - Simple linear regression
  - Multiple linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - K means
  - Perceptron 
  - Delta rule
  
There are 4 runnable examples:
  - AND function solved with perceptron and delta rule,
  - Binary classification of Iris data set with perceptron and delta rule, as well as clustering with K-means,
  - Linear regression for a stock price with delta rule.
  
The repository will be expanded with more algorithms, data preparation, feature analysis, evaluation metrics and so on as i find free time to do this.

# PRESENTATION
Resources directory contains presentation with detailed explanation of Naive Bayes, Perceptron and Delta rule as well as overview of Multi-layer feed forward networks.
